      <li>Three projects were based on the BioNova® system, currently very widely used for natural pools in the USA.</li>
      <li>As in the UK, we found only fairly intensively technically equipped model 3 and 4 pools in the USA.</li>
      <li>Assessment and recommendations Though some goldfish and koi carp live in the pool, the water looks per- fectly clear.</li>
      <li>The phosphorus filter system is only turned on if algae or critical water analysis values indicate it is necessary.</li>
      <li>Partitioning and purification methods The circular swimming area is surrounded by a 2.5 m wide filter bed regeneration zone.</li>
      <li>Several Iris species, Typha minima, Myriophyllum aquaticum, Hibiscus coccineus and Mentha aquatica are already established.</li>
      <li>At its edge the filter substrate is separated from the swimming zone by a wall made of six lay- ers of gravel-filled pond-sacks.</li>
      <li>Instead of a massive wall, a steep slope leads from the 2 m deep swimming area up to the regeneration zone.</li>
      <li>Above The waterfall at the east side is a very shallow feature but appears effective because of its width.</li>
      <li>Below Keeping fish in a swimming pool is not recommended by most experts, but here they have not so far affected the water quality.</li>
