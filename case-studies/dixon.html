      <li>The case study is located to the north-west of the centre of Exeter - UK (USDA zone 8a). The site is dominated by a slope and was modified by structural measures so that the pond facilities and the natural pool are ideally integrated into the surroundings. The slope to the west has been terraced in several sections, firstly to secure the underlying terrain, but also to create new utilisation possibilities. To this end, the bridge at the highest point of the property was demolished and redesigned so that the existing stream runs underneath it and can flow towards the garden. Care was taken to ensure that the stream could be optimally integrated into the overall project. Coming from the south, the water cascades over small and large, precisely placed natural stones into an approx. 60 m² pond basin at the foot of the farmhouse. These gradations also ensure that the rising water does not develop into a torrent in winter. Starting from the pond basin, the water from the stream is channelled past the natural pool by means of a ditch (see Fig. 1) and down into two settling basins that are offset in height. The ditch is designed to prevent the swimming pond from flooding in the event of high water. Two 50 cm diameter sewer pipes (KG pipe) are installed under the ditch for further drainage. After the course of the stream was adjusted, the natural pool was planned in the resulting trough. The trough was extended further and a swimming area with a filter and planting zone was created. Starting from the sedimentation basin, the stream flows below the road through two 50 cm wide sewer base pipes. From there, it flows into another pond basin and is channelled back into its original form.</li><li>The natural pool is located to the west of the house in the centre of the property (see Fig. 2). The pool measures approx. 100 m² and is surrounded by a wooden deck on the left and the filter zone and shallow water zone on the right. A formal design was chosen for the swimming pool itself. Integrated boulders serve as diving rocks. These can be reached from the upper and lower parts of the pool through the shallow water zone. The area is surrounded by a wooden walkway that leads to both the house and the wooden deck.</li><li>The terraced slope in the background provides an optimal view of the natural pool on several levels. The individual terraces are enclosed by natural stone walls and are used in different ways by the owner. Whether as an outdoor kitchen with integrated vegetable and herb beds, as a simple retreat or as a fireplace. The terraces offer a welcome change with fantastic views. The natural stone walls are skilfully designed and integrate perfectly into the site itself. Well thought-out planting of the individual walls brings additional colour and texture to the garden, making the wall appear more lively. The different heights of the natural stone walls also leave room for expansiveness and therefore do not restrict the plot, but rather expand it.</li><li>The case study north-west of Exeter, UK, has a biofilm-building substrate filter (BSF), a sand filter pump and a UV light filter to keep the pool water clean. A surface skimmer, an underwater gravel suction system, two pumps and three inlet nozzles are also installed. The substrate filter in the case study is 15 m² in size and was designed to be completely submerged. This means that it is below the water surface.</li><li>The BSF system is an intensively flowing filter bed that oxidises dissolved phosphorus well. The resulting compound is then bound in the filter. The filter's biofilm successfully absorbs nutrients and effectively removes them from the water. In order to maintain constant phosphorus reduction, percolation takes place 24 hours a day. This ensures that the biofilm is constantly maintained and damage is avoided. The filter contains little to no anaerobic areas due to the additional air supply. Bacteria that live under anaerobic conditions do not need oxygen for their cycle. The rapid flow of water through the substrate provides the water with a stable aerobic environment. Aerobic bacteria need oxygen for their metabolism and to live. The water flow rate through the filter should be 1.5 m/h. The BSF system concentrates on the biofilm as the main cleaning method. Biofilm, also known as biological turf, has the task of cleaning the water in the natural pool. It grows in all areas under water that are supplied with oxygen and light. It consists of algae, fungi, bacteria and viruses that continuously communicate with each other. A three-dimensional matrix is created. This substrate filter can create a biofilm on the filter medium within a short time. This can then optimally purify the water with a constant supply of oxygen through conversion and decomposition processes. If the filter system is switched off or the oxygen supply is cancelled, this can have considerable consequences. ‘The redox potential in the filter drops to 0 or below - the pH value and oxygen saturation also drop - this releases phosphorus that was bound in the filter. This results in shock fertilisation with subsequent mass algae formation in the pond.’ In order to support the biofilm as well as possible, a very permeable substrate (kf value  103) is required. This enables a good microclimate with even water movement. It is important to ensure that the substrate does not exceed a phosphate content of 6 mgP/kg. When designing the filter system, care must be taken to ensure that there is a coarse-grained layer at the bottom as a water distribution zone and a stabilisation layer at the top. The case study has a depth of 1.50 m and was constructed as follows: Distribution layer incl. central supply line with integrated distribution system, an intermediate layer, the filter layer, the top layer and the surface water (see Fig. 3).</li><li>In order to get the current algae problem under control, a UV system for disinfecting the water was installed in addition to the filter systems described above. The system was integrated into the existing water system. The water, which is sucked in by pump 1 via the underwater gravel intake, first flows through the flow housing of the UV filter. It is then channelled along the UV lamp from all sides. This allows the UV light to kill algae and germs (see Fig. 4). The intensive irradiation ensures that algae clump together and become more easily caught in the mechanical cleaning chambers. The UV system runs daily due to the high degree of algae contamination. However, this also has disadvantages. The constant exposure to ultraviolet light not only kills algae and germs, but also important microorganisms. As a result, the water may gradually be transformed into ‘sterile’ water in which bacteria can no longer participate in the transformation process, such as the nutrient cycle. It also damages the biofilm that has already formed.</li><li>There is also a sand filter pump in which the water flows through a filter sand. This consists of a grain size of 0.4-0.8 mm, which also filters the water that has already been sucked in to remove algae and insects. The sand filter pump has several functions that can be operated via the 6-way valve.</li><li> Filtering: Water is pressed through the filter sand and pumped back into the natural pool. This function is in permanent use.</li><li> Return flow: The water flows from the bottom upwards through the sand filter so that the dirt is loosened and can be transported to the outlet. If clear water flows through the outlet, the filter has been sufficiently backwashed.</li><li> Rinsing: After the return flow, the water flows through the filter again from top to bottom. This distributes and compacts the sand in the filter again. The filter can then continue to work normally.</li>
